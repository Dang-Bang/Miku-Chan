# Pull Request Template
Thanks for helping develop Miku-Chan! We gretly apprefciate it. Anywho, let's get into a template for that pull request of yours.

### Refrencing
When you make your pull request, we won't merge if it adds more commands (most of the time). We'll commonly merge bug fixes. However, you have to do some preporations on that as well:
  + Refrence the Issues you Fix (provide a #(issue number) or the issue URL)
  + State Main Changes (edited README.md and renamed bot.py to bot.js)
  + Mention us, the developers (add @Incrested, @d-nni3l, and @ultraMLGCode to the bottom of the pull

### Getting Merged
If you get merged, you'll username will be added to the "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" file with your first name (and last initial), your psedonym, and a link to your GitHub.

If you don't get merged, that's alright too. We might do it in the future or simply fix your fix to work with Miku-Chan better.
