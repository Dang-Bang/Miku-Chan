# Issue Template
Hello Miku-Chan User! We want to quickly thank you for using our bot. Anywho, let's go over the Issue Requirements:

## 1) Defining Your Issue
When you propose an issue, you first state your issue and the commmit version you are using. For instance, say that a command (be specific) is not functioning as it should and is instead doing something.(be specific)

## 2) Stating Usable Logs
You've proposed your issue, add a .log/.txt/.xml log file to the issue or take a snippit of the console that states the error for us to fix. Again, make sure this is a clear photo or log that also is proper.

## 3) Methods You've Tried to Repair
You shouldn't post an issue without a workaround. It's like you can't say no more dogs without an alternative. Try to find a way that might be able to fix it and include it in code brackets (3 grave accents wrapped around the code).

## 4) Submit
Just submit your post, remember to click Watch and Star to make sure you get updates and we will try to fix your issue ASAP and even help out if it's server-side.
